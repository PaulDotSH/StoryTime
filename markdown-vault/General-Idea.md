# StoryTime
- Collaborative reddit-like story-writing platform.
- Each user can post a snippet which becomes the start of the story, other users can reply with comments, or continue the story snippet with other snippets.
- Each snippet can be voted. After 24h if the story snippet is a parent, and it was not completed, the most voted "last" snippet gets made "cannon"
- User score = upvotes - downvotes
- Each snippet will have comments.
- Comments also have replies which work on a notification system
- Notification system
- After 24h posts are mad cannon
- Snippets can be marked as "final", which will end the story if they get voted.
- Think of a way to implement PPs, stripe payment, awards, profile badges, profile checkmark?, custom profile (subscription based)
